# HealthcareDashboard
A Tableau dashboard showcasing analytics conducted on the Flu shot data in the state of Massachusetts. Created 4 tables in a PostgreSQL database and loaded the data from text files. After performing some basic data modeling, cleanup and normalization created the Analytics.sql file which contains the query for the data used in the analytics dashboard.
Created the dashboard using Tableau and you can find the link here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/prasanna.venkatesh.thambuanantharaman/viz/FluDashboard_17069199043940/FlushotsDashboard
